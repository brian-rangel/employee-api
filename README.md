# Employee API
This program was created in Java and HTML/CSS. It utilizes the Spring framework to create 
fully-functional RESTful APIs that interacts with a relational database in the back-end. 
The front-end contains an interface which allows the user to create, read, update, and delete 
employees stored in the database. It will display all the employees currently stored in the database
by default. The user can also search for employees using filters. The database was created using 
H2 database. This program also supports parsing CSV files and storing that data into 
the database.
